            So why should I buy <strong>this</strong> game that a shady guy <br>
            on the internet
            named William told me to buy? <em>Well</em> here's why my dear reader.
            <br>
            Because its a spectacular game! <br>It even got a story recently.
            Just go buy it!

            lets talk more about the story. Rare (the creator of the game) partnered<br>
            with Disney to bring Jack Sparrow from Disney's pirates of the caribean <br>
            to Sea of Thieves in a thrilling campaign. I would highly recomend it <br>
            as it is possibly the best campaign I have ever played. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Chapter one of the campaign is it bit slow, but a great beggining <br>
            to a great campaign. Chapter two was extremely fun and was one of <br>
            the most fun things I have ever done on an xbox.  Chapter three was...<br>
            fun? It was interesting, but a bit basic compared to the last two chapters.<br>
            I haven't played chapters 4 or 5 yet, but I definitely have some high hopes.

            *Spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk*

            You start chapter one by going to where the castaway is on any outpost,<br>
            and voting for the voyage called "A Pirates Life". The castaway will<br>
            begin to start talking and giving story. Once she is done talking, a portal<br>
            will open and you need to sail through it. You are taken to <br>
            the sea of the damned where you see spirits in small row boats.<br> 
            You go through another portal and are introduced to a rather spooky island.<br>
            You go onto the island and find a cave with a statue in front of it.<br>
            Inside the cave is a series of puzzles that usually consist of lighting the lanters<br>
            with your lantern. After getting through the puzzles, you go outside and<br>
            are introduced to a huge dead shipyard, a lighthouse, and an abundace of eerieness.<br>
            After doing more puzzles to free the skull of a captain who helps you get into<br>
            and summon the ferry of the damned. Once summoned, you sneak onto it and free<br>
            Jack Sparrow. While you free him, the ship gets moving and gets attacked<br>
            by Davy Jones and his ginormous ship. After fending him and other enemies off<br>
            for a little while, the chapter ends with Jack Sparrow falling off the ferry and<br>
            you returning to the living world.
            <br>
            <br>
            The next chapters continue the story with more puzzles and an abundance of fun.<br>
            Chapter two is definitely the best from what I have played, but each chapter has its own<br>
            charm. I would highly recommend this game, but there is more to it on the next page.
