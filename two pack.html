            Lets talk about the rest of the game. While the campaign is truly amazing, <br>
            there is a lot more to Sea of Thieves than in-depth stories.<br>
            The main mode that everyone plays is the adventure mode. In adventure mode, you<br>
            are a pirate trying to collect money by doing tasks. What kinds of tasks? Well to answer<br>
            that, we must talk about the trading groups/emissaries.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are a total of 5 trading groups that will give you quests. <br>
            Each trading company can be leveled up by doing quests for them. Once you reach<br>
            a certain level with that trading company, you can buy an emissary flag from them.<br>
            Once you buy a flag, it can be voted on to raise. Once it is raised, you become an emissary<br>
            for that trading company and get lots of benefits. Now lets break down the individual trading companies.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>THE GOLD HOARDERS 
            <br>
            is a group of hoarders that give you chest finding missions that are relativly easy. They are<br>
            the first group that you will be doing missions for, and can be done with either a group<br>
            or by yourself. Definitely a staple in the Sea Of Thieves.</ol> 
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> THE ORDER OF SOULS
            <br>
            is a group of crazy people who give you skeleton killing missions that can be a bit hard. They a typically<br>
            the second group that you will be doing missions for, and are usually done alone. They to are a staple in the<br>
            Sea Of Thieves
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> THE MERCHANT ALLIANCE
            <br>
            is a group of buisness oriented people that give you cargo finding and delivering missions. They are<br>
            the third group that you will do. They are the easiest and can be easily done alone. While not known extremely<br>
            well, they are very useful.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> THE REAPERS BONES
            <br>
            is a group unlike any other. While most other groups can be found at outposts, the reapers are at only one<br>
            location. They also will buy anything that you have, including the reaper's chest and humble gifts.<br>
            They even buy emmisary flags. They are a very interesting group in the Sea Of Thieves.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
            There are a few more trading groups, but these are the main ones. I highly<br>
            recommend that you buy Sea Of Thieves due to the vast amount of things to do in it.
