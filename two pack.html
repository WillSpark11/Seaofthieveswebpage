            Lets talk about the rest of the game. While the campaign is truly amazing, <br>
            there is a lot more to Sea of Thieves than in-depth stories.<br>
            The main mode that everyone plays is the adventure mode. In adventure mode, you<br>
            are a pirate trying to collect money by doing tasks. What kinds of tasks? Well to answer<br>
            that, we must talk about the trading groups/emissaries.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are a total of 5 trading groups that will give you quests. <br>
            Each trading company can be leveled up by doing quests for them. Once you reach<br>
            a certain level with that trading company, you can buy an emissary flag from them.<br>
            Once you buy a flag, it can be voted on to raise. Once it is raised, you become an emissary<br>
            for that trading company and get lots of benefits. Now lets break down the individual trading companies.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>THE GOLD HOARDERS 
                <br>is a group that gives you chest fetching</ol>
